# AudioRecorder
This is a very basic audio recorder written in Python 3.7 using PyAudio and wave. The goal of this application was to implement threading seamlessly, as well as creating an application with a minimalist aspect.
## Installation
If you would like to use AudioRecorder immediately, you can use the .exe file in the dist folder, on any Windows 10 machine.

To compile the code, there is one dependency: PyAudio.
### PyAudio Installation:
Installation of PyAudio is easiest via the conda package manager, if you have anaconda installed. Otherwise, you must resort to the method described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52283840/i-cant-install-pyaudio-on-windows-how-to-solve-error-microsoft-visual-c-14) if the pip install does not work correctly.
